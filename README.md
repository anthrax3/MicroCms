#MicroCms

##Basics
MicroCms is intended to be a lightweight CMS engine that can be hosted inside of an existing ASP.NET MVC site.  It gives some basic classes around content types, parts, items, documents and templates, and provides several simple extensibility points for where you want to store your content, and an ability to create your own content types and renderers.

##Status
The code is just now coming together.  An alpha release should be out sometime in August.
