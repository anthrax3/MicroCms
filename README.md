#MicroCms

##Basics
MicroCms is intended to be a lightweight CMS engine that can be hosted inside of an existing ASP.NET MVC site.  It gives some basic classes around content types, parts, items, documents and templates, and provides several simple extensibility points for where you want to store your content, and an ability to create your own content types and renderers.

##Status
The code is just now coming together.  There are some early alpha build packages available on NuGet that are semi-usable.  Look at the MicroCmsWeb project for examples of using the framework until some more detailed documentation is available
